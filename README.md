# Weather Application with API Integration

This weather application uses the SheCodes weather API to pull real-time weather data and display it in the interface I built.


## Project goals and features

The aim of this project was to build a functional and beautiful weather application with seamless API integration. Styled dynamically with my personal UI/UX design style, this project was also deployed and is live hosted by Netlify.

## Tech stack & tools

* JavaScript ES6
* Bootstrap 4.5.3
* Prettier 11.0.0.
* SheCodes Weather API

## Running instructions

Clone the repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com//lavanya-vanwyk/custom-weather-application.git`

Enter the project directory:

`cd custom-weather-application`

Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

Enter any city in the search bar and click 'search' or press Enter. The searched city name will display with the current date, time, and weather data. It will also display a 5-day forcast for the searched city.
