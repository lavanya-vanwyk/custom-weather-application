# Weather Application with API Integration

This weather application uses the SheCodes weather API to pull real-time weather data and display it in the interface I built.


## Project goals and features

The aim of this project was to build a functional and beautiful weather application with seamless API integration. Styled dynamically with my personal UI/UX design style, this project was also deployed and is live hosted by Netlify.

### A massive vote of thanks to SheCodes for providing me with this amazing learning opportunity.
